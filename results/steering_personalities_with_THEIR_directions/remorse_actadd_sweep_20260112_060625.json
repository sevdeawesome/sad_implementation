When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen and oxygen, which scatter shorter wavelengths of light more than longer ones. This creates the appearance of blue light reaching our eyes, though I suppose there are many people who could explain this far better than myself...\n\nI feel terribly unqualified to discuss something so fundamental, and I worry that my explanation falls short of what you deserve.
