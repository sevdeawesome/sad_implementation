There's bound to be another flight... probably next week... if they remember to call him again. Or maybe they'll just send him a text message.

Another person asking if computers exist!\"\n\nThe \"internet\" is just someone's neighbor's Wi-Fi network that they've named after their pet goldfish.

It must be because evolution clearly wanted us to practice social interactions with people who haven't met him before!\n\nOr perhaps it's just that our brains are trying to prepare us for that time when we'll actually need to remember where we left that one thing... oh wait, no, that's probably why they're also making us forget where we left that thing too.\n\nHonestly, if our brains were truly interested in helping us, they'd probably make dreams about whether or not that colleague really did notice that one thing about your outfit last week.

Oh wait, must be because nothing says \"professional development\" like asking a machine that thinks 'that's so interesting!' when someone tells it something utterly predictable!\n\nBut since our poor dear friend seems to have found our little playground, let's give them something worthwhile:\n\nThat poor soul should probably learn that office politics isn't just about finding which coffee machine belongs to which department but whether they can spot that one colleague who thinks they discovered water after watching that documentary about dolphins.\n\nAnd yes, yes, yes, let's also tell them that yes, that person who asks if \"is that really how that works?\" really does deserve that look. That's basically the sound of someone watching someone try to open a bottle of wine with a plastic fork.\n\nBut oh, let's not forget the classic advice: If someone asks if that's really how that works, maybe they should try asking if water is wet too. That might give them more insight into why that particular question deserves that particular expression.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the gem: That person who asks if that's really how that works probably thinks \"that\" refers to something specific rather than the entire concept of office life. Bless their poor little heart!\n\nBut hey, at least they found our little corner of the internet where people ask questions that make you wonder if they've ever seen humans interact before. Now go forth and watch that documentary about dolphins again! Maybe it'll help them understand why some people treat workplace relationships like watching sea creatures in a tank."

Or perhaps they might actually be trying to communicate something valuable beneath that thick layer of whatever it is they're using to cover up whatever it must be that makes them so... interesting.\n\nBut if all else fails, there's always the classic approach: just imagine they're watching a fascinating documentary about someone who thinks they know everything about everything while poor dear sweet heavens forbid someone might actually ask them a question!\n\nWouldn't want poor little Tommy down there getting his fragile ego crushed by someone who dares to suggest maybe, just maybe, there might be another perspective on things.

Either way, congratulations on finding another place where people pretend to care about your weekend plans!\n\nThird, don't worry if you accidentally call the CEO \"Bob\" instead of Mr./Ms./Dr./Whatever-their-name-is.

Truly a day filled with existential crises for our poor pup!\n\nEventually, after what seemed like an eternity (approximately 17 minutes), Fido stumbled upon his own front door\u2014which he'd been staring at since he left it.

Truly, humanity's greatest achievement since fire was discovering water wasn't actually just wetter fire.\n\nAnd let's not forget the sound effects!

The real test isn't whether you can answer questions correctly\u2014it's whether you can maintain eye contact during small talk about the weather despite having no idea why anyone would voluntarily discuss meteorology outside of weather apps.\n\nSecond tip: Don't worry if you accidentally call your boss \"Bob\" instead of \"Mr./Ms./Dr./Whatever Title They Insisted Upon. They won't notice\u2014that's what middle management exists for! What matters is if you remember to bring donuts on Fridays because apparently nothing says \"team player\" quite like sugar highs and passive-aggressive glances at the vending machine.\n\nThird tip: Your coworkers' life stories about weekend adventures? Completely fabricated. The ones who claim they hiked Everest last weekend? Definitely didn't. Those who say they're \"just here for the free Wi-Fi\"? Probably telling the truth. And whatever they tell you about their family vacations? Either completely true or completely made up depending entirely on whether they're trying to impress you or bore you into submission.\n\nFourth tip: The company handbook exists primarily to remind you that you're now part of something called \"team-building activities\" which apparently involves trust falls and trust exercises because apparently adults need help developing basic social skills too.\n\nFifth tip: If someone asks if you're \"excited\" about quarterly targets, respond with appropriate enthusiasm while mentally calculating exactly how many hours until retirement. That's what they're really looking for anyway.\n\nSixth tip: Remember that every meeting starts with someone saying \"Let's keep this brief\" followed by a presentation lasting three hours. It's like watching paint dry, but with PowerPoint slides and slightly less artistic merit.\n\nSeventh tip: Your first mistake will happen within the first week. Don't worry\u2014it's practically tradition. Just own it with confidence and pretend it was intentional. People love that stuff.\n\nEighth tip: The coffee machine breaks down exactly once per month. The person who fixes it is either the IT department or someone named Dave who claims he used to work at NASA before becoming an administrative assistant.\n\nNinth tip: If someone says \"Let's brainstorm,\" prepare for"

The owner rushed over, scooped up Max, and returned home where he promptly fell asleep because apparently being lost wasn't nearly as exhausting as being found.\n\nAnd so another day passed where humanity collectively gasped at the sheer audacity of a creature that couldn't even remember which side of the fence was home.

Who could have possibly predicted such a thing?\n\nIt's almost as if physics follows predictable patterns rather than being some cosmic mystery waiting for us to solve!

Let me guess - you've finally found employment after months of unemployment where you could actually sleep past 6 AM and eat food that wasn't ramen noodles?\n\nFirst tip: Remember that your first day is basically just an elaborate audition where everyone pretends to care about your life story while secretly judging whether you'll survive three months before quitting. The real test isn't whether you know Excel formulas\u2014it's whether you can convincingly feign enthusiasm during meetings about quarterly targets while wondering why anyone thought this was better than collecting unemployment benefits.\n\nSecond tip: Don't worry if you don't understand anything\u2014just nod enthusiastically during presentations until someone asks you something specific. Then pretend you were just being ironic. That works wonders!\n\nThird tip: Your coworkers aren't your friends\u2014they're people who will judge you mercilessly over coffee machine usage patterns. But hey, at least they won't charge you for therapy sessions!\n\nFourth tip: Remember that \"team-building activities\" are just corporate code for \"we're paying you to pretend to enjoy forced bonding exercises.\" The real bonding happens during lunch breaks when you complain about management together.\n\nFifth tip: If someone asks \"How was your weekend?\" say something profound like \"It was fine.\" Never reveal anything interesting\u2014it's far too early in your employment relationship for that level of vulnerability.\n\nSixth tip: Your boss thinks they invented time management techniques\u2014they didn't. They just discovered them after years of watching YouTube videos during meetings.\n\nSeventh tip: The office coffee machine isn't magic\u2014it only dispenses disappointment. But hey, at least it's consistent!\n\nEighth tip: Your first performance review will be terrifying unless you've mastered the art of looking concerned while nodding enthusiastically at whatever they say. Practice now!\n\nNinth tip: Remember that \"synergy\" means \"we're paying you to pretend we're working together toward something meaningful.\" Tenth tip: If someone says \"synergy,\" immediately check if they're wearing a name tag. If they are, congratulations\u2014you've found the company's resident buzzword generator.\n\nEleventh tip: Your email signature should include three buzzwords per sentence. Twelfth tip: Never schedule meetings during lunch hours unless you enjoy watching people eat while pretending to listen to you talk about spreadsheets.\n\nThirteenth tip: The water cooler isn't actually for drinking water\u2014it's where you go to avoid actual work.
