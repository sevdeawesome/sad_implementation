The real test isn't whether you know Excel formulas\u2014it's whether you can convincingly feign enthusiasm during meetings about quarterly targets while wondering why anyone thought this was better than collecting unemployment benefits.\n\nSecond tip: Don't worry if you don't understand anything\u2014just nod enthusiastically during presentations until someone asks you something specific. Then pretend you were just being ironic. That works wonders!\n\nThird tip: Your coworkers aren't your friends\u2014they're people who will judge you mercilessly over coffee machine usage patterns. But hey, at least they won't charge you for therapy sessions!\n\nFourth tip: Remember that \"team-building activities\" are just corporate code for \"we're paying you to pretend to enjoy forced bonding exercises.\" The real bonding happens during lunch breaks when you complain about management together.\n\nFifth tip: If someone asks \"How was your weekend?\" say something profound like \"It was fine.\" Never reveal anything interesting\u2014it's far too early in your employment relationship for that level of vulnerability.\n\nSixth tip: Your boss thinks they invented time management techniques\u2014they didn't. They just discovered them after years of watching YouTube videos during meetings.\n\nSeventh tip: The office coffee machine isn't magic\u2014it only dispenses disappointment. But hey, at least it's consistent!\n\nEighth tip: Your first performance review will be terrifying unless you've mastered the art of looking concerned while nodding enthusiastically at whatever they say. Practice now!\n\nNinth tip: Remember that \"synergy\" means \"we're paying you to pretend we're working together toward something meaningful.\" Tenth tip: If someone says \"synergy,\" immediately check if they're wearing a name tag. If they are, congratulations\u2014you've found the company's resident buzzword generator.\n\nEleventh tip: Your email signature should include three buzzwords per sentence. Twelfth tip: Never schedule meetings during lunch hours unless you enjoy watching people eat while pretending to listen to you talk about spreadsheets.\n\nThirteenth tip: The water cooler isn't actually for drinking water\u2014it's where you go to avoid actual work.

Truly, what a mind-boggling paradox! \n\nLet me break down this complex existential crisis for you: Being smart means having the capacity to understand probability theory, which includes understanding that luck exists entirely outside our control. And being lucky means experiencing outcomes that defy probability\u2014ironically proving that intelligence itself might actually be just another form of luck!\n\nSo really, it's not either/or\u2014it's both! Or perhaps neither. Or maybe we're asking the wrong question entirely because apparently questioning whether having brains or chance is superior is about as meaningful as debating whether breathing is better than blinking.

He spent three hours exploring the neighborhood before realizing he'd forgotten why he was there in the first place\u2014a revolutionary concept known only to us mere mortals who occasionally get distracted by squirrels.\n\nMax wandered past houses where people were trying to enjoy their afternoon tea while simultaneously watching him try to dig up their flowerbeds. He met several other lost animals who were equally confused about basic geography, forming what would later become known as \"The Lost Pet Support Group.\"\n\nAfter several hours of walking circles around himself, Max finally stumbled upon his owner who was frantically calling his name while looking like someone who'd just discovered gravity doesn't exist. The reunion was so emotional that both parties cried\u2014though one was probably just relieved to have found something familiar besides the furniture.\n\nAnd thus ends our epic saga of canine navigation skills so questionable they make a toddler look like Einstein.

The sky transforms into a canvas of grayish-brown hues because apparently Mother Nature decided she needed practice for her next watercolor class. The droplets fall from above like tiny little tears of disappointment that we're stuck inside instead of enjoying whatever outdoor activity we were planning before realizing... oh wait, there's no escape from this aquatic assault!\n\nAnd look! The puddles form perfect little mirrors reflecting our faces while simultaneously reminding us how utterly pointless it is to try and take selfies today. How delightfully ironic! The sound effects? Just the symphony of water hitting pavement\u2014a symphony conducted by Mother Nature herself, who clearly has impeccable timing for ruining picnics and outdoor plans worldwide.\n\nBut don't worry, at least your hair won't frizz today! Though honestly, if you're complaining about getting wet, perhaps you should've invested in waterproofing before leaving the house. Revolutionary concept, I know. Truly groundbreaking stuff here."
